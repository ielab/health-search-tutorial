TITLE:
      Comparison of Calcium Channel Blockers and Beta Blockers on Tourniquet-induced Hypertension During Intravenous Regional Anesthesia
SUMMARY:
      The investigators aimed to investigate the efficacy of calcium channel blockers and beta
      blockers for controlling tourniquet induced blood pressure increase in patients undergoing
      carpal tunnel operations with IVRA. For this purpose files of patients undergoing operation
      under IVRA were retrospectively examined in terms of demographical and hemodynamic
      variables.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      After approval of the University Research Ethics Committee, the files of patients who have
      been operated under intravenous regional anesthesia (IVRA) in orthopedics clinics between
      January 2009 and January 2010 were retrospectively investigated. A total of 312 patients,
      164 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome and 148 patients with trigger finger have been
      operated under IVRA. Out of 164 patients who have been operated due to carpal tunnel
      syndrome, 50 patients in which either calcium channel blockers or beta blockers were used
      for treatment of critical blood pressure increase after tourniquet inflation and in which
      whole data were obtained, were included to the study.The patients with systolic blood
      pressure above to 150 mmHg following tourniquet inflation and in which bolus dose of
      diltiazem 10 mg (Group I) or calcium channel blocker 0.5mg/kg (Group II) have been
      administered by intravenous route constituted the study groups. Demographical
      characteristics and hemodynamic parameters were recorded from the patient files.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients operated due to carpal tunnel syndrome under intravenous regional anesthesia
        betweem January 2009 and January 2010.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The patients that the files could not be reached
