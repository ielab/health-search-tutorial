TITLE:
      Myocarditis Treatment Trial
SUMMARY:
      To determine whether immunosuppressive treatment improved cardiac function in patients with
      biopsy-proven myocarditis.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      BACKGROUND:

      Heart failure due to myocarditis can be a devastating illness. At the same time,
      immunosuppressive therapy is associated with considerable risks of untoward side effects.
      Clinicians did not know whether, under what circumstances, or in what form, this hazardous
      treatment should be used in such critically ill patients. In addition, if immunosuppressive
      therapy was of benefit, then endomyocardial biopsy in patients suspected of having
      myocarditis was a justified procedure. The trial also provided information concerning the
      side effects of immuno-suppressive therapy in such patients.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Patients were randomized into two treatment arms consisting of conventional therapy alone
      for congestive heart failure or combined with a twenty-four week regimen of
      immunosuppressive therapy. Immunosuppressive therapy consisted of prednisone with either
      cyclosporine or azathioprine. The primary outcome measure was a change in the left
      ventricular ejection fraction at twenty-eight weeks. Secondary endpoints included survival,
      failures of therapy, requirements for conventional therapy, assessments of symptoms,
      myocardial histology, and arrhythmias.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the Query/View/Report
      (QVR) System.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Men and women, 18 years of age or older, with left ventricular failure and
        biopsy-documented myocarditis.
