TITLE:
      Women's Antioxidant and Folic Acid Cardiovascular Study (WAFACS)
SUMMARY:
      To determine if supplements of vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, and B-vitamins (a
      combination of folic acid, vitamins B6 and B12) reduce risk of major cardiovascular events
      in high risk women with a prior history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The trial
      is a companion to the Women's Health Study (WHS), a primary prevention trial of vitamin E
      and aspirin in a low risk population of women.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      The Women's Antioxidant and Folic Acid Cardiovascular Study tested the effects of vitamin C
      (500 mg/day), vitamin E (600 IU every other day), and/or beta carotene (50 mg every other
      day) on the risk of major cardiovascular events (a combined outcome of myocardial
      infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, or cardiovascular death) among 8171 female
      health professionals at increased risk. Participants were 40 years or older with a history
      of cardiovascular disease or 3 or more cardiovascular risk factors and were followed for an
      average duration of 9.4 years, from 1995-1996 to 2005. In 1998, 5442 of these participants
      were further randomized to the B-vitamin intervention (a daily combination pill containing
      folic acid [2.5 mg], vitamin B6 [50 mg], vitamin B12 [1 mg]) and were followed for 7.3
      years, from April 1998 through July 2005.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Women, aged 40 and over, at high risk, with a history of cardiovascular disease or three
        or more coronary heart disease risk factors.
