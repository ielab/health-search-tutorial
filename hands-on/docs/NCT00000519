TITLE:
      Exercise Training and Plasma Lipoproteins in Man
SUMMARY:
      To determine the effects in moderately obese subjects of weight loss by combined dieting and
      exercise training on risk factors for coronary artery disease including lipoprotein lipids,
      apoproteins and blood pressure.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      BACKGROUND:

      Evidence appears to be fairly conclusive that obesity has adverse effects on health and
      longevity when the relative body weight is 40 percent above desirable weight based on
      insurance industry tables of weights. The close association between obesity, hypertension,
      hypercholesterolemia, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, an excess of certain cancers
      and other medical problems makes it imperative that interventions be directed to change the
      lifestyles and behaviors of individuals who are overweight. The Stanford Weight Control
      Project (SWCP) trial examined the effects of weight loss on cardiovascular disease risk
      factors.

      The Stanford Weight Control Project (SWCP) randomized 155 overweight, sedentary, non-smoking
      men, aged 30-59 years, to one of three groups. Fifty-one were assigned to weight loss
      through dieting, 52 to weight loss through exercise, and 52 to a control, non-intervention
      group. Follow-up continued through July 1989.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Subjects were randomized to a control group, a hypocaloric National Cholesterol Education
      Program (NCEP) diet, or to a hypocaloric NCEP diet with exercise. One hundred nineteen of
      the men and 112 of the women returned for testing after one year.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Men and women, ages 25-49. Subjects were overweight with blood pressure less than 160/95
        mm Hg and total cholesterol less than 260 mm/dl.
