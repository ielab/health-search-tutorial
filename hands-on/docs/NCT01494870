TITLE:
      Management of Acute Myocardial Infarction in the Presence of Left Bundle Branch Block
SUMMARY:
      The primary objective of this study is to propose new treatment algorithm (strategy) for
      patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) and left bundle-branch block (LBBB).
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      Current recommendations on the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) dictate urgent
      reperfusion therapy in the case of evolving myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation
      (STEMI). Optimal use of PCI (preferably) or thrombolysis in this situation requires a rapid
      and correct diagnosis.

      According to the ESC'2008 and ACC/AHA'2009 focused update guidelines patients admitted to
      the hospital within 12 hours after the onset of chest pain with new (or presumably new) left
      bundle-branch block (LBBB) should be treated like patients having STEMI (class I, level A).
      However, it is well-known that in patients with concomitant LBBB, the ECG manifestations of
      acute myocardial injury may be masked.

      ACS may occur in a patient with "true old" LBBB (when doctor has/has not an ability to
      compare the new ECG with the previous one) or (presumably) new LBBB.

      There is a high risk of non receiving appropriate therapy or of receiving inappropriate
      therapy (thrombolysis instead of LMWH/UFH/fondaparinux).
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 - 75 years

          -  Ischemic discomfort (ie, ischemic chest pain or equivalent) at rest ≥20 minutes
             within previous 24 hours.

          -  Any (new, presumably new, or old) LBBB on the prehospital (ambulance) or admission
             ECG.

          -  Urgent coronary angiography (followed, when indicated, by PCI), ideally within 90
             minutes after admission

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  all-comers design
