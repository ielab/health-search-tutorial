TITLE:
      NHLBI Type II Coronary Intervention Study
SUMMARY:
      To determine whether lowering of cholesterol with cholestyramine in a population with Type
      II hyperlipidemia led to a decreased rate of progression (a regression of coronary artery
      disease) as demonstrated by death, myocardial infarction, or progression of disease on
      angiography.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      BACKGROUND:

      There is overwhelming evidence that increased cholesterol levels are associated with
      increased risk of cardiovascular disease. This study examined whether lowering of
      cholesterol through drug therapy in people who had coronary artery disease as determined by
      angiography led to regression of the disease, again as indicated by angiography and
      reduction in mortality or nonfatal myocardial infarction. The study should be contrasted
      with the Coronary Primary Prevention Trial (CPPT), which determined whether lowering
      cholesterol through a combination of drug and diet therapy resulted in decreased
      cardiovascular mortality. It should be noted that patients in the CPPT did not have known
      preexisting coronary heart disease.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      A randomized, double-blind trial, with single experimental and control groups. The
      experimental group received drug therapy (cholestyramine); the control group received
      placebo. Both groups received diet therapy. The endpoints were a significant difference in
      the progression of coronary disease as shown by angiography or a significant difference in
      new myocardial infarction or death. Patients were followed under therapy for at least 5
      years.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Men and women with angiographically demonstrated coronary artery disease.
