TITLE:
      Pulmonary Embolism Response to Fragmentation, Embolectomy, & Catheter Thrombolysis: PERFECT
SUMMARY:
      A prospective observational study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness data of
      catheter-directed therapy (CDT) including percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy (PMT) for
      treatment of acute pulmonary embolism (PE)
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      The primary objective of this study is to capture high quality patient safety and
      effectiveness data on CDT for acute PE. The goal will be achieved by capturing a concise set
      of immediate and short-term functional and clinical outcome data for PE patients undergoing
      CDT.

      Secondary study objectives include the following:

      - To assess and benchmark clinical practice patterns (patient selection, optimal technique,
      use of procedure worldwide)

      These objectives will be achieved through the capture of selected process data for patients
      included in the registry. Data collected in this study may also be used to develop and
      refine standards of care for use of CDT for PE and to facilitate the design of randomized
      clinical trials
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must be Age greater than or equal to 18

          -  Obtain informed written consent.

          -  Diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolism (PE) (< 14 days)

          -  Catheter-directed therapy (CDT) was performed to treat acute PE
