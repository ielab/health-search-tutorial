TITLE:
      Lateral Cord Stimulation as a New Treatment for Refractory Spastic Cerebral Palsy
SUMMARY:
      The aim of our work is to investigate whether electrical Lateral Cord Stimulation (LCS)
      causes an inhibitory and modulatory action by indirect cerebellar activation, so releasing
      spasticity and the spastic syndrome in selected cases of patients with cerebral palsy
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      PROJECT Lateral Cord Stimulation was thought by the author to be employed in patients with
      spastic cerebral palsy with the aim to improve tonus, motor function and speech.

      Nevertheless, as it has been demonstrated as acting on the basic phenomena related with
      spasticity, it's to say the propagated spinal responses, its use could be extended to other
      forms of spastic disease, like spastic limbs post stroke, brain congenital malformations
      producing spasticity and motor disorders as the main signs, post anoxic encephalopathy, etc.

      In this preliminary clinical trial, classed as phase 3, our sample must be very limited to
      assure stable conditions for statistical significance, hence our group is going to be
      circumscribed to certain conditions and pathology.

      In the future, as long the method could spread its use, the extension on indications in
      other pathological conditions is advisable thus, its possibilities of marketing could be
      enlarged with its use in a broader spectrum of spastic patients.

      Calculated risks are similar to those related with the ancient surgical technique called
      "Scoville"technique, currently employed time ago for cervical discectomy (6) Investigational
      plan The purpose of this clinical trial is to release spasticity and by this means improve
      the condition of patients with spastic cerebral palsy by extradural lateral cord electrical
      stimulation, by using currently employed electrodes and neurostimulators Those devices are
      already FDA approved and currently used for Dorsal Column Stimulation with the objective to
      treat chronic Pain and spasticity (Spasmodic Torticollis).
