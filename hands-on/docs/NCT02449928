TITLE:
      Using Sodium Lactate Ringer's Injection Resuscitate Septic Shock Patients
SUMMARY:
      Using sodium lactate Ringer's injection resuscitate septic shock patients and Compared with
      other solution, in order to make clear whether can improve the prognosis.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      Experimental evidence repeatedly demonstrated that the shock patients can use substrates
      other than glucose to sustain increased activity, including lactate.Increased lactate can be
      the consequence of anaerobic metabolism, i.e., the formation of lactate in the presence of
      low oxygen. However, emerging evidence demonstrated that in patients with sepsis increased
      lactate seems predominantly non-hypoxic/ischemic and rather the consequence of increased
      glycolysis. Utilization of lactate as an alternative fuel may be an adaptive response to
      maximize energy function and limit substrate reduction.Uptake of exogenous lactate has
      indeed been demonstrated after traumatic brain injury and acute heart failure in humans.

      The investigators assume that administration of supplemental lactate significantly
      contributes to energy metabolism in septic shock, which can have beneficial help for septic
      shock resuscitation.

      Inclusion criteria:diagnosis in patients with septic shock and age 18 years old or more.
      Exclusion criteria: pregnant women and nursing mothers, severe liver failure with child
      class C , use linezolid anti-infection treatment, pheochromocytoma patients, CVVH therapy
      patients, malignant tumor patients, using epinephrine.

      The investigators will use sodium lactate Ringer's injection resuscitate septic shock
      patients and Compared with other solution, the organ function monitoring include heart,
      kidney,and brain. Others study endpoints include 28-day mortality,hospitalized mortality.
