TITLE:
      Clinical Trial Characterizing the Bioavailability of 1-Octanol in Adults With Ethanol-responsive Essential Tremor
SUMMARY:
      OVERVIEW

      Essential tremor (ET) is a common movement disorder affecting 0.4% of the general population
      and up to 14% of people 65 years and older. Response to medications such as beta blockers
      and primidone may be of benefit, but are often accompanied by intolerable side effects.
      Response to ethanol, on the other hand, has a roughly 80% chance of significant tremor
      reduction, though daily use of this as a treatment has potentially serious medical, social,
      and legal consequences.

      The leading hypothesis for ET pathophysiology is an unmasking of spontaneous oscillations
      originating in neurons of the inferior olive. Both ethanol and 1-octanol have been shown to
      reduce these spontaneous oscillations in an animal model of ET; however, 1-octanol does this
      at a dose much lower than that leading to intoxication, suggesting in may be useful in the
      treatment of essential tremor. Our initial studies with 1-octanol have shown it to be safe
      at dosages up to 64mg/kg without signs of intoxication, while at the same time showing
      benefit.

      OBJECTIVE

      We plan to evaluate the efficacy of different 1-octanol formulations in humans based on
      accelerometry and spirography. We will also evaluate drug and metabolite bioavailabilities
      using a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) detection method from plasma and urine
      samples.

      STUDY POPULATION

      We will study adult subjects with ethanol-responsive Essential Tremor (ET).

      DESIGN

      This study is designed as a two-phase unblinded inpatient study of adults with ET receiving
      weight-adjusted oral dosages of 2 different formulations of 1-octanol in a crossover
      fashion. Phase I of the study is designed to develop an octanol detection assay using HPLC.
      Four subjects will receive daily escalating dosages (1-32 mg/kg) of a single 1-octanol
      formulation followed by a crossover trial of both formulations at a dosage of 64 mg/kg.
      Phase II will study 20 subjects receiving one of the two formulations at 64 mg/kg on
      inpatient day 1 followed by a 24 hour period of close monitoring. The second formulation
      will be given on day 3 and the patient will again undergo close monitoring for 24 hours.

      OUTCOME MEASURES

      The primary outcome measures for the study will be efficacy based on tremor ratings from
      accelerometry and spirography. Secondary outcome measures will be the determination of
      bioavailability, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles of octanol #61864 and octanol
      #68751 and their metabolites.

      Response to ethanol, on the other hand, has a roughly 80% chance of significant tremor

      The leading hypothesis for ET pathophysiology is an unmasking of spontaneous oscillations

      STUDY POPULATION

      We will study adult subjects with ethanol-responsive Essential Tremor (ET).

      DESIGN

      This study is designed as a two-phase unblinded inpatient study of adults with ET receiving
      weight-adjusted oral dosages of 2 different formulations of 1-octanol in a crossover
      fashion. Phase I of the study is designed to develop an octanol detection assay using HPLC.

      will be given on day 3 and the patient will again undergo close monitoring for 24 hours.

      OUTCOME MEASURES

      The primary outcome measures for the study will be efficacy based on tremor ratings from
      accelerometry and spirography. Secondary outcome measures will be the determination of
      bioavailability, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles of octanol #61864 and octanol
      #68751 and their metabolites.

      Addendum: Based on the results of the assays for all subjects who participated in Part 1 and
      2 of this protocol, we would like to conduct an exploratory study (Part 3) consisting of two
      subjects receiving a dose of 128mg/kg of 1-octanol. This is meant to primarily explore the
      plasma concentration of 1-octanol, while also providing valuable information regarding the
      safety and efficacy at this higher dose. The remainder of the experimental design will be
      maintained, with exception of additional safety precautions which will be discussed in the
      protocol and consent.
