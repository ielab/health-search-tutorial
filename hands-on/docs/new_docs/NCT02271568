TITLE:
      Prospective Cohort Study of the Effect of Bariatric/Metabolic Surgery on Morbid Obesity Patients With Metabolic Syndrome
SUMMARY:
      The purpose of this study is to determine the change in kidney function and blood pressure
      after gastric bypass versus conventional medical therapy in morbid obesity. The study mainly
      focus on glomerular filtration rate(GFR) with known relation to the renal function and 24
      hours ambulatory blood pressure monitoring after intervention of gastric bypass or medical
      treatment.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      Metabolic syndrome is strongly associated with obesity and the patients with this syndrome
      are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease.

      Obesity constitutes a strong risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease.
      Among diabetics, obesity is known to amplify the risk for kidney disease.

      Bariatric surgery has yielded dramatic results including longitudinal loss of excess body
      weight and either complete reversal or significant improvement of several features of
      metabolic syndrome. In addition, many observational studies have demonstrated significant
      reduction in proteinuria after bariatric surgery.

      However, the changes in the component of cardiovascular problem among metabolic syndrome and
      changes in renal filtration function or progression to end stage kidney disease in morbidly
      obese patients after weight loss surgery have not been extensively studied. Therefore, our
      study mainly focus on glomerular filtration rate(GFR) with known relation to the renal
      function and 24 hours ambulatory blood pressure monitoring after intervention of gastric
      bypass or medical treatment.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

             dyslipidemia, or hypertension)

          -  Morbid obese patients (BMI>35)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior bariatric surgery

          -  Malignancy (any type)
