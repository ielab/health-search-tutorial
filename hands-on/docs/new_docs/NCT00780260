TITLE:
      Case Management Alternatives for African American Women at High Risk for HIV
SUMMARY:
      The purpose of this study is to test two innovative case management approaches designed to
      increase linkages and engagement with drug abuse treatment, HIV-related care, and other
      health services among an underserved population of African American women at risk for HIV.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      The study is fundamentally concerned with the implementation and evaluation of
      theoretically-based, culturally appropriate case management interventions targeting
      individual, social and environmental factors among highly vulnerable African American women.
      The research is designed to test innovative, comprehensive approaches to HIV
      prevention/intervention through case management driven service linkage and engagement.
      Testing new approaches to intervention with African-American women at high risk for HIV
      addresses a particularly urgent public health need in Miami, as well as other large
      metropolitan areas, where officials continue to document epidemic rates of HIV/AIDS
      clustered in urban, impoverished African-American communities.

      Comparison: Participants will be randomly assigned to: a Strengths-Based / Professional Only
      Condition in which clients participate in a "strengths-based" case management approach; or,
      a Strengths-Based / Professional/Peer Condition in which a team composed of: a) a
      credentialed, professional case manager and b) a recovering addict peer - both trained in
      "strengths-based" case management techniques - develop and facilitate the implementation of
      a service plan.
