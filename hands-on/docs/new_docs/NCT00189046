TITLE:
      Effects of Pain on Driving Performance and Cognition.
SUMMARY:
      It has been suggested that cognitive functioning is impaired in chronic pain patients. Since
      most of these pain patients engage in daily activities including driving, it was
      hypothezised that they may have an increased risk of becoming involved in traffic accidents.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      Most chronic pain patients engage in daily activities including driving. Driving a car is a
      complex task requiring mental alertness and a variety of cognitive functions such as
      perception, attention, learning, memory and decision making.Several studies have
      demonstrated cognitive impairments on laboratory tasks in patients with chronic pain,
      particularly on measures assessing attentional capacity, processing speed and psychomotor
      speed. These findings suggest that car driving performance might be impaired, and that
      chronic pain patients may therefore have an increased traffic accident risk. Unfortunately,
      no studies have investigated the impact of chronic pain on actual driving ability. The
      present study was designed to investigate the effects of chronic pain on actual driving
      performance during normal traffic. In addition to the on-the-road driving test, psychomotor,
      and memory tests measuring driving-related skills were conducted in the laboratory.
      Moreover, effects of pain on an attentional capacity test were tested using event-related
      potentials.
