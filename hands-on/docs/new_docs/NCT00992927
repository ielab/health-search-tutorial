TITLE:
      Should the Joint Capsule of the Painful Stiff Shoulder be Ruptured During Intra-articular Hydraulic Distension?
SUMMARY:
      The purpose of the study is to compare the efficacy of intra-articular hydraulic distension
      (IHD) for the treatment of painful stiff shoulders between capsule-rupturing and
      capsule-preserving IHDs.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      The Painful stiff shoulder (PSS), or the adhesive capsulitis, involves stiff and contracted
      joint capsule from fibrosis in the glenohumeral joint. Intra-articular hydraulic distension
      (IHD) enlarges the stiffened capsule by deforming it with excessive volume and pressure
      within the joint space. Although IHD is one of the most common treatment options for the
      PSS, the diversity of the IHD technique spans wide range. Specifically, it is not generally
      agreed as for which, between capsule-rupturing and capsule-preserving IHDs, is superior for
      PSS treatment. Capsule-preserving IHD might fail to infuse sufficient amount of fluid to
      avoid rupture, thus producing less satisfactory outcomes. However, we devised in our
      previous study a novel technique that enabled a physician to infuse the possible largest
      volume without rupturing the capsule. By employing the technique, we aim to compare the
      clinical efficacy of capsule-rupturing versus capsule-preserving IHDs in patients with PSSs.
