TITLE:
      Sirolimus-eluting Stents With Biodegradable Polymer Versus an Everolimus-eluting Stents
SUMMARY:
      Coronary artery stents have improved the safety and efficacy of percutaneous coronary
      intervention for coronary artery disease. Drug-eluting stents have been shown to decrease
      neointimal hyperplasia and to reduce the rate of restenosis and target-lesion
      revascularization as compared to bare-metal stents. Drug-eluting stents consist of a
      metallic platform and a therapeutic substance that is usually released from a polymer
      matrix. A previous study utilizing a bioresorbable polymer has demonstrated a favorable
      safety and efficacy profile in a large-scale clinical trial as compared to a
      first-generation druf-eluting stent (LEADERS trial).

      The objective of the study is to compare the safety and efficacy of a sirolimus-eluting
      stent with a biodegradable polymer with an everolimus-eluting stent with a durable polymer
      in a prospective multicenter randomized controlled non-inferiority trial in patients
      undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention in routine clinical practice.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      Background

      Coronary artery stents have improved the safety and efficacy of percutaneous coronary
      interventions compared with balloon angioplasty alone (New Engl J Med 1994; 331:489-495).
      Notwithstanding, restenosis is still encountered in 20 to 30% of lesions after implantation
      of bare metal stents (JAMA 2000; 284:1828-36) and may require repeat revascularization
      procedures with a negative impact on quality of life and health care expenditures.
      Drug-eluting stents with local, controlled release of therapeutic agents have addressed this
      problem successfully (Circulation 2003; 107:3003-7). Current drug-eluting stents consist of
      a metallic stent platform and a therapeutic agent, which is either directly immobilized on
      the stent surface or released from a polymer matrix. Polymers currently utilized for
      drug-eluting stents are either biodegradable or non-biodegradable. While biodegradable
      polymers are released together with the drug and dissolve after a certain period of time,
      non-biodegradable polymers reside permanently on the stent surface.

      First-generation drug-eluting stents utilized sirolimus and paclitaxel for prevention of
      restenosis. Both drugs are highly lipophilic and show rapid and strong uptake in arterial
      wall tissue. In addition, Sirolimus (Circulation 2001; 104:852-5) and paclitaxel
      (Circulation 1997; 96:636-45) have been shown to reduce smooth muscle cell proliferation and
      neointimal hyperplasia, the principal cause of restenosis after coronary stenting in
      experimental models. A polymer-encapsulated stent releasing Sirolimus has been compared with
      the respective bare metal stent in several randomized clinical trials, demonstrating a
      consistent reduction in angiographic and clinical restenosis (N Engl J Med 2002;
      346:1773-80). Similarly, a polymer-based, paclitaxel-eluting stent consistently reduced
      restenosis and the need for repeated revascularization procedures compared with the
      respective bare metal stent (N Engl J Med 2004; 350:221-31). A meta-analysis of drug-eluting
      stent trials confirmed the reduction in restenosis and repeat revascularization procedures
      for polymer-based, drug-eluting stents (Lancet 2004; 364:583-91). Moreover, the rates of
      death and myocardial infarction were comparable to those with bare metal stents, attesting
      to the safety of these devices, which have been approved by the US Food and Drug
      Administration.

      Newer generation drug-eluting stents with durable polymer coating utilize Limus analogues
      such as everolimus, zotarolimus or novolimus. Everolimus-eluting stents have been compared
      to first-generation drug-eluting stents in several randomized clinical trials. A pooled
      analysis of the four largest randomized trials to date comparing everolimus-eluting stents
      with paclitaxel-eluting stents demonstrated a lower rate of MACE (4.4% versus 7.6%),
      myocardial infarction (2.1% vs. 4.0%, p<0.001), ischemic TLR (2.3% vs. 4.7%, p<0.001), and
      definite stent thrombosis (0.4% vs. 1.2%, p<0.001) in favor of EES, whereas there was no
      difference with regard to overall and cardiac mortality (Stone GW. The XIENCE V - PROMUS
      Everolimus-Eluting Stent: New Insights from the SPIRIT/COMPARE Meta-analysis and other
      randomized trials. Presentation at Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics, September 22nd
      2010). At the same time several trials comparing everolimus-eluting stents with
      sirolimus-eluting stents reported favorable performance of everolimus-eluting stents. In a
      randomized trial enrolling 2'774 patients everolimus-eluting stents were non-inferior
      compared with sirolimus-eluting stents at nine months with regard to MACE (4.9% vs. 5.2%, HR
      0.94, 0.67-1.31) and TLR (1.4% vs. 1.7%, HR 0.87, 0.48-1.58) (N Engl J Med
      2010;362(28):1663-74). Likewise, event rates at two years were similar for
      everolimus-eluting stents and sirolimus-eluting stents (3.7% versus 4.3%, p=0.85) in a
      randomized controlled trial comparing EES, SES, and BMS in large vessels (stent diameter
      >3.0 mm), whereas TVR was lower with both EES (3.7%) and SES (4.3%) as compared with
      bare-metal stents (10.3%, P=0.005 vs SES, P=0.002 vs EES) (N Engl J Med
      2010;363(24):2310-9). A propensity-score matched comparison of EES and SES reported lower
      event rates of myocardial infarction (3.3% versus 5.0%, HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.42-0.92, P=0.017)
      in part due to a lower risk of stent thrombosis (definite or probable 2.5% versus 4.0%, HR
      0.64, 95% CI 0.41-0.98, P=0.041), as well as a lower rate of target vessel revascularization
      (7.0% versus 9.6%, HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.57-0.99, P=0.039) for EES at three years while
      mortality was similar (Windecker S. Long-term comparison of Everolimus-eluting and
      Sirolimus-eluting Stents for coronary revascularization 1 (LESSON1) study. Presentation at
      the European Society of Cardiology meeting, Stockholm, Sweden, 31st August 2010. 2010).

      A previous study utilizing a bioresorbable polymer has demonstrated a favorable safety and
      efficacy profile in a large-scale clinical trial as compared to a first-generation
      drug-eluting stent. Among 1,707 patients randomized to either a biolimus-eluting stent with
      a bioresorbable polymer or a sirolimus-eluting stent with a durable polymer no significant
      differences with regard to the primary endpoint of cardiac death, myocardial infarction or
      target-vessel revascularization were observed (9.2% versus 10.5%, HR 0.88, 95% CI
      0.64-1.19;: p=0.39)(Lancet 2008;372:1163-73.)
