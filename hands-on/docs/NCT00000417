TITLE:
      Psychoeducational Approach to Improve Health in Lupus
SUMMARY:
      We will study the relationships among patient/partner communication, social support, and
      self-efficacy (a person's belief in the ability to manage his or her disease) as they affect
      the health of people with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, or lupus) over time. We are
      assigning 150 people with lupus and their partners to either (1) receive counseling to
      improve self-efficacy, partner support, and patient/partner problem solving or (2) see an
      informational film about lupus. We will follow study participants for 12 months to find out
      about their physical and mental health, disease activity, beliefs that they can take steps
      that help them feel better, coping, social support, and couples communication.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      Studies have shown that patient self-efficacy in disease management and social support
      predict physical and mental health and disease activity in lupus. We wished to study the
      relationships among patient/partner communication, social support, and self-efficacy as they
      influence patient health longitudinally. We are randomizing 150 lupus patients and their
      partners to either (1) participate in a counseling intervention to improve self-efficacy,
      partner support, and patient/partner problem-solving in lupus management or (2) see an
      informational film about lupus (control). The counseling intervention includes an initial
      in-person session followed by five monthly telephone calls to monitor and reinforce
      problem-solving. We will follow patients for 12 months for self-reported physical and mental
      health, disease activity, self-efficacy, coping, social support, and couples communication.
