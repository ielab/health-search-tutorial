TITLE:
      Prevention and Treatment of Hypertension Study (PATHS)
SUMMARY:
      To evaluate the long-term effect of reduction of alcohol intake on blood pressure in
      moderate but non-dependent drinkers with mild hypertension or high normal blood pressure.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      BACKGROUND:

      Numerous observational epidemiologic studies have established ethanol intake as one of the
      most important determinants of blood pressure levels. However, data from intervention
      studies were very limited.

      The study was an inter-agency agreement involving the Veterans Administration and the
      National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA). Protocol development occurred
      between October 1988 and June 1989. The protocol was approved by the VA Cooperative Studies
      Evaluation Committee in July 1989 and reviewed by a separate Data and Safety Monitoring
      Board in September 1989.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Subjects were randomized to intervention or control groups. Intervention aimed to reduce
      alcohol intake to no more than 14 drinks per week and 50 percent or less of each
      participant's baseline level. The intervention technique consisted of a cognitive-behavioral
      program, the intensive phase of which consisted of six counseling sessions over three
      months. Echocardiograms were obtained at baseline and six months after randomization.
      Biochemical markers were used to validate changes in alcohol consumption. The trial included
      an eighteen-month feasibility phase with six-month follow-up and a 36-month main trial with
      two years of follow-up. Recruitment for the full-scale trial ended in June 1993. Final study
      visits were conducted in September and October 1994.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Men and women with a diastolic blood pressure of 80 to 89 mm Hg and alcohol intake of 21
        drinks or more per week.
