TITLE:
      Fibroid Growth Study
SUMMARY:
      Uterine leiomyomas, commonly called fibroids, are a major health concern for women of
      reproductive age. The objectives of the study described herein are to investigate the growth
      dynamics of uterine leiomyomas in a clinically relevant population of women. We will test
      the hypotheses that uterine leiomyomas are heterogeneous in terms of their growth
      characteristics and in their clinical symptoms or outcomes, and that differences in
      leiomyoma growth dynamics can be discriminated by molecular markers and cellular phenotypes.
      Participants will include 300 premenopausal women (greater than 18 years old) with at least
      one uterine leiomyoma. The inclusion criteria for patient enrollment is confirmed diagnosis
      of leiomyoma by ultrasound. At least one leiomyoma must be equal to or greater than 2 cm in
      diameter and the uterus must be enlarged to the size typical during the eigth week of
      pregnancy. After enrollment and informed consent, T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance
      image (MRI) scans will be conducted beginning at the first visit and then at 3, 6, and 12
      months. Each patient will have a physical exam, provide urine and blood samples at each MRI
      visit, and respond to an initial extensive telephone-administered questionnaire followed by
      abbreviated monthly questionnaire updates. A number of the enrolled women will require
      surgical intervention (hysterectomy/myomectomy) as standard care. If surgery is an outcome
      for women enrolled in the study, MRI will be conducted before surgery and the surgical
      pathologist will map uterine leiomyomas for comparison to MRI. Leiomyoma samples will be
      analyzed for histopathological and molecular changes correlated with growth. Because
      hysterectomy and myomectomy are common outcomes in women with leiomyomas, we anticipate
      tissue will be available from at least 100 of the 300 women in the study. For those women
      who opt for surgery, we will also administer a brief (less than 5 minute) questionnaire
      clarifying their reason for electing surgery. Upon completion of data collection, we will be
      able to compare leiomyoma growth as a function of multiplicity and location; examine the
      relationship between leiomyoma growth and clinical symptoms or outcome; identify molecular,
      cellular, and pathological characteristics of leiomyomas with differing growth dynamics; and
      examine endocrinological parameters and lifestyle factors related to differential growth
      dynamics of uterine leiomyomas. The data may be used to establish a clinical severity scale
      and establish diagnostic markers currently not available for uterine leiomyomas.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      Uterine leiomyomas, commonly called fibroids, are a major health concern for women of
      reproductive age. The objectives of the study described herein are to investigate the growth
      dynamics of uterine leiomyomas in a clinically relevant population of women. We will test
      the hypotheses that uterine leiomyomas are heterogeneous in terms of their growth
      characteristics and in their clinical symptoms or outcomes, and that differences in
      leiomyoma growth dynamics can be discriminated by molecular markers and cellular phenotypes.
      Participants will include 300 premenopausal women (greater than 18 years old) with at least
      one uterine leiomyoma. The inclusion criteria for patient enrollment is confirmed diagnosis
      of leiomyoma by ultrasound. At least one leiomyoma must be equal to or greater than 2 cm in

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Women included in the study must be at least 18 years if age, premenopausal, speak
        English, and have one or more uterine leiomyomas at least 2 cm in diameter and the utuerus
        must be enlarged to the size typical during the 8th week of pregnancy. Note that while the
        selcetion criteia are set to recruit women in which surgical intervention is a likely
        outcome, surgery is not a requirement for study inclusion.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Women will be excluded if they are pregnant because of potential safety concerns
        associated with imaging and image contrast enhancements. If women become pregnant during
        the study, they wil have the option to stay in the study, but will have pelvic ultrasound
        scans in place of MRI scans.

        Women who are taking or likely to start taking GnRH therapy will be excluded because this
        therapy, which is used as a treatment method for leiomyomas, sometmes induces their
        regression.

        Women who are greater than 52 inches in circumference or greater than 350 pounds will be
        excluded because they will be too large to fit in the imaging equipment.

        Women that have an intra-uterine device (IUD) will be excluded because these metal devices
        create 'shadowing' in MR images, making accurate measurement and interpretation of
        leiomyomas in the MRIs difficult.

        Women are not excluded if they had a prior myomectomy, or if they are taking oral
        contraceptives.

        The inclusion of only women of premenopausal age (greater than 18 years old) in this study
        is dictated by the nature of the condition.
