TITLE:
      Central Hypothyroidism and Cardiovascular Risk
SUMMARY:
      Retrospective trial of 300 patients with pituitary insufficiency treated in Department of
      Medica Endocrinology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University concerning levothyroxine (T4)
      replacement and cardiovascular risk factors. The hypothesis is that subtle central
      hypothyroidism is associated with adverse cardiac risk factors, such as body composition and
      serum lipids, and that improved T4 replacement will eliminate this increased risk,
      independently of other pituitary hormone replacements.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      Retrospective trial of 300 patients with pituitary insufficiency treated in Department of
      Medical Endocrinology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University concerning levothyroxine (T4)
      replacement and cardiovascular risk profile. The patient files are recruited among
      hypopituitary patients treated with growth hormone from the period 1993 to 2008. The trial
      is a retrospective assessment of data already collected for routine purposes and thus an
      audit of daily clinical practice. All information on the patients is obtained from the paper
      and electronic files existing in the department and no new measurements are foreseen.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients with pituitary hypopituitarism

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unavailability of data
