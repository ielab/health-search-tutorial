TITLE:
      The Association of Costimulatory Molecules and PPAR-polymorphisms With Autoimmune Thyroid Disease in Taiwan
SUMMARY:
      Autoimmune thyroid disease is the most common organ-specific autoimmune disease. AITD
      include Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Although the pathogenesis of AITD
      remains unclear, it is generally thought that the mechanisms of the disease is a complex
      disease in which susceptibility genes and environmental triggers act in concert to initiate
      the autoimmune response to the thyroid.

      The initial step of thyroid autoimmunity is the activation of T cells. The activation of T
      cell requires two signals: firstly, thyroid follicular cells or antigen presenting cells
      binds to T cell receptor through antigenic HLA complex. Secondly, the activation of T cells
      is also required the interaction of costimulatory molecules between thyroid follicular cells
      and immune cells, including CTLA-4, CD 40, CD28, ICOS. PPAR- is a kind of intranuclear
      transcription factor, associated with adipogenesis and inflammation. Some reports showed
      that PPAR- polymorphism may have a protective effect from Graves' ophthalmopathy.

      The goal of the study is to investigate the relationship among SNP and mRNA of costimulatory
      molecules and PPAR- , serum cytokine including TNF- and sIL-2R, and clinical characteristics
      in AITD patients. From the study, we hope to clarify the role of costimulatory molecules and
      PPAR- polymorphism in AITD.
