TITLE:
      Vitamin D and Zinc Levels in Patients Undergoing Ergometry Test
SUMMARY:
      Low vitamin D levels were found to be associated with cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality. Low zinc levels are associated with an increased atherosclerotic burden.
      Therefore we hypothesized that patients with pathological stress test would have low levels
      of Vitamin D and zinc compared to patients with a normal stress test.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      Hypovitaminosis D is generally defined as 25(OH)D levels of < 20ng/ml, while levels of
      21-29ng/ml indicate insufficiency and those above 30ng/ml are regarded as sufficient.

      The rational behind the observations associating vitamin D deficiency with CVD is that on
      the one hand, hypovitaminosis D was found to be associated with traditional risk factors
      such as hypertension (HTN),diabetes mellitus (dm),obesity, dyslipidemia and metabolic
      syndrome , on the other hand, experimental data demonstrated that vitamin D could affect
      cardiac muscle cells directly, control parathyroid (PTH) hormone secretion, regulate the
      rennin- angiotensin- aldosterone system and the immune system, all of which could influence
      cardiovascular risk.

      Epidemiological studies further support this association, demonstrating high prevalence of
      hypovitaminosis D among U.S. adults with cardiovascular disease (74%). An association
      between low vitamin D levels and increased myocardial infarction risk as well as total
      mortality has been also observed.

      Low 25hydroxyvitamin D[ 25(OH)D] levels were also independently associated with all cause
      and CVD mortality among patients scheduled for coronary catheterization.
