TITLE:
      Multimodal Treatment Study of Children With Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (MTA)
SUMMARY:
      This trial is a continuation of the Multimodal Treatment Study of Children with Attention
      Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (MTA Study). Continuation Aim 1 is to track the persistence
      of intervention-related effects as the MTA sample matures into mid-adolescence, including
      subsequent mental-health and school-related service utilization patterns as a function of
      MTA treatment experience (treatment assignment) and outcome (degree of treatment success at
      14 mo.). Aim 2 is to test specific hypotheses about predictors, mediators, and moderators of
      long-term outcome among children with ADHD (e.g., comorbidity; family functioning; cognitive
      skills; peer relations) that may influence adolescent functioning (either independent of or
      through initial treatment assignment and/or 14-month treatment outcomes); and to compare how
      these predictors, mediators, and moderators are similar or dissimilar within the normal
      comparison group. Aim 3 is to track the patterns of risk and protective factors (including
      their mediation or moderation by initial treatment assignment and/or outcome) involved in
      early and subsequent stages of developing substance-related disorders and antisocial
      behavior. Aim 4 is to examine the effect of initial treatment assignment and degree of
      treatment success on later academic performance, achievement, school conduct, tendency to
      drop out, and other adverse school outcomes.

      In the original MTA design, patients were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment conditions:
      (1) medication only; (2) psychosocial only; (3) combined (medication and psychosocial); or
      (4) Assessment-and-Referral condition. All but the latter were treated intensively for 14
      months, with assessments for all subjects at baseline, 3, 9, 14, and 24 months. The original
      MTA design thus provides short-term (10 months post-treatment) follow-up at 24 months. This
      continuation extends the follow-up to assessments at 36, 60, and 84 months after treatment.

      A child may be eligible for this study if he/she:

      Is 7 - 9 years old, and has Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
