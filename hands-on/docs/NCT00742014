TITLE:
      The Assessment of Right Ventricular Contractility in Response to Sildenafil
SUMMARY:
      The primary objective of this study is to examine the effects of Sildenafil, administered
      during cardiac catheterization, on right ventricular contractility in children with
      pulmonary arterial hypertension.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      The effectiveness of Sildenafil as a pulmonary vasodilator in children with heart disease
      was first reported in detail during cardiac catheterization and postoperatively in 2003. It
      is now used frequently for long-term treatment of children with pulmonary arterial
      hypertension at The Hospital for Sick Children and it is now a routine part of the
      hospital's testing protocol for all patients being evaluated for pulmonary hypertension in
      the cardiac catheterization laboratory.

      The beneficial effects of Sildenafil in pulmonary hypertension are thought to result
      predominantly from relative vasodilatory and antiproliferative effects on the pulmonary
      vasculature. On the basis of early data showing lack of significant PDE5 expression in the
      normal heart, PDE5 was thought to be expressed in the coronary vessels but not in the human
      myocardium. Very recently, it was reported for the first time that PDE5 is markedly
      upregulated in hypertrophied right ventricular myocardium in humans and that in the rat PDE5
      inhibition with Sildenafil increases contractility in hypertrophied right ventricular
      myocardium but not in normal right ventricle, which lacks PDE5 expression. The assessment of
      right ventricular contractility in humans is a challenge, but we have developed several
      techniques that are recognized as 'state of the art' assessment of right ventricular
      function.

      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of Sildenafil, which is routinely
      administered during cardiac catheterization to assess pulmonary vascular resistance, on
      right ventricular contractility in children with pulmonary arterial hypertension.
