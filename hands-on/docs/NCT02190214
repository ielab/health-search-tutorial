TITLE:
      Thyroid Disorders in Malaysian: A Nationwide Multicentre Study
SUMMARY:
      This will be a population based study looking at the prevalence of thyroid disorders in
      Malaysia (including hypo- and hyperthyroidism, subclinical hypo- or hyperthyroidism) and its
      association with different ethnicity and iodine status. The study will also look at genetic
      susceptibility for autoimmune thyroid disorders in the Malaysian population

      General hypotheses:

      The prevalence of thyroid disorders in Malaysia is 10% for hypothyroidism and 2% for
      hyperthyroidism Hypo- and hyperthyroidism is associated with iodine status in our population
      There are different susceptibility gene for autoimmune thyroid disorder in different
      ethnicity in our population
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      This will be a cross-sectional population based study involving Malaysian adults (aged 18
      year old and above). Cluster sampling will be used to select respondents that will be
      representative of the Malaysian population. Selected respondent will be interviewed,
      anthropometric measurement taken, blood and urine sample taken.

      Blood will be analyzed for thyroid function (thyroxine, triiodothyronine and thyroid
      stimulating hormone), autoantibodies (anti-thyroperoxidase and anti-thyroglobulin). Urine
      will be analyzed for urinary iodine.

      Those diagnosed with autoimmune thyroid disorders with strong family history of thyroid
      disorders (multiplex multi-generation family involvement) will have their blood sent for
      whole exome sequencing and linkage analysis done to identify possible susceptible gene for
      autoimmune thyroid disorders

      Respondents detected to have hypo- or hyper- and subclinical hypo- or hyperthyroidism will
      be referred to their nearest health centre for further evaluation and treatment appropriate
      for their condition.
