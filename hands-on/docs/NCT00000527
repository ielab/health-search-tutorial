TITLE:
      Recurrent Carotid Stenosis
SUMMARY:
      To determine whether recurrent stenosis following carotid endarterectomy could be reduced by
      pre- and post-operative oral administration of platelet-inhibiting drugs.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
      BACKGROUND:

      Following endarterectomy, platelets adhere and aggregate on the endarterectomized surface
      and release platelet-derived growth factor which induces smooth muscle cell migration and
      proliferation which may result in restenosis. Many patients had been treated with aspirin
      and dipyridamole, but not in a controlled trial. The Recurrent Carotid Stenosis Study
      established whether antiplatelet therapy was beneficial in the prevention of recurrent
      carotid artery stenosis.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Randomized, double-blind. Eighty-three patients (90 endarterectomies) were randomly assigned
      to receive 325 mg of oral aspirin plus 75 mg of dipyridamole, beginning 12 hours
      pre-operatively, followed by a second dose administered within eight hours after the
      operation, and given three times daily thereafter for one year. Eighty patients (85
      endarterectomies) received placebo. After the adequacy of the surgical procedure was
      confirmed by intraoperative angiography, restenosis at the endarterectomy sites was
      evaluated using serial duplex ultrasound before hospital discharge and at three-month
      intervals postoperatively for one year.
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:
      Men and women who had recently undergone carotid endarterectomy.
