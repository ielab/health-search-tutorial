  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-range goal of this ongoing research program is to find more effective treatments
      for alcohol dependence by combining medication with the appropriate psychosocial support.
      This proposal has three specific aims: (1) to compare the effectiveness of naltrexone
      (Revia) in three types of treatment settings; (2) to assess the effects of psychosocial
      support on medication compliance and treatment retention; and (3) to investigate the
      individual characteristics that may predict who is likely to benefit from additional
      psychosocial support versus simple medication management.
