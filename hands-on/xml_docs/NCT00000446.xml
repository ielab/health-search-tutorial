    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the use of sertraline (Zoloft) to decrease alcohol consumption
      and crime-related post-traumatic stress disorder in those individuals with both disorders.
      This will be a 12-week, placebo-controlled, double-blind outpatient trial.

      All subjects will receive cognitive behavioral therapy in addition to a placebo or
      sertraline. Comprehensive evaluation will be done at study entry; treatment termination; and
      6, 9, and 12 months after study entry.
