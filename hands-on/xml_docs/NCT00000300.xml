      The purpose of this study is to test therapeutic benefits of take-home LAAM. (1) Do subjects
      with take-home LAAM availability show increased clinical responsibility over subjects
      without; (2) Do subjects with take-home LAAM attempt diversion when random recall and other
      diversion safeguards are used; (3) Does treatment response correlate with background or drug
      use variables at intake, discharge, or during treatment?
