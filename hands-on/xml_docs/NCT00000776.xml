    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effect of corticosteroids on reducing elevated intracranial pressure in
      cryptococcal meningitis. To evaluate the safety of corticosteroids in patients with
      cryptococcal meningitis and intracranial hypertension.

      In AIDS patients with cryptococcal meningitis, a correlation has been found between early
      death and elevated intracranial pressure. Since dexamethasone has been found to reduce
      intracranial pressure resulting from other forms of meningitis, it may be of benefit in AIDS
      patients with cryptococcal meningitis.

      intracranial pressure resulting from other forms of meningitis, it may be of benefit in AIDS
      patients with cryptococcal meningitis.

      Patients are randomized to receive dexamethasone or placebo every 6 hours for 72 hours (days
      1 through 3). Additionally, standard antifungal therapy with amphotericin B and flucytosine
      is given for 2 weeks, followed by fluconazole for 8 weeks. Lumbar punctures will be
      performed daily on days 1 through 3, on days 7 and 14, and at week 10.
