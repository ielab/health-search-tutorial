      To determine the effectiveness of oral paromomycin sulfate for 21 days compared to placebo
      in the treatment of cryptosporidiosis in patients with HIV infection. To evaluate the safety
      of oral paromomycin at two different doses. To explore whether paromomycin administered over
      a longer period provides additional benefit.

      In previous studies, patients with cryptosporidiosis demonstrated dramatic improvement with
      paromomycin therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In previous studies, patients with cryptosporidiosis demonstrated dramatic improvement with
      paromomycin therapy.

      Patients are randomized to receive either placebo or paromomycin for 3 weeks. After the
      initial double-blind phase, all patients receive open-label paromomycin for 3 weeks.
      Following 6 weeks of therapy, patients who do not achieve a complete response receive a
      higher dose of paromomycin for an additional 3 weeks, while complete responders continue
      receiving the original dose for an additional 3 weeks. Complete or partial responders after
      9 weeks may receive 16 additional weeks of optional maintenance therapy at the dose at which
      their response was achieved. Treatment continues for up to 25 weeks total. Patients are
      followed at weeks 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9, and then at 2-4 week intervals.
