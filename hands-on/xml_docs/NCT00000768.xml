  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the oral bioavailability of three dose levels of oral ganciclovir given with
      and without glutamic acid hydrochloride in patients with cytomegalovirus (CMV) GI disease,
      and to compare the bioavailability of these regimens to that of standard intravenous (IV)
      ganciclovir.

      Long-term ganciclovir maintenance therapy has been recommended for CMV colitis or
      esophagitis following induction treatment. Oral ganciclovir is a likely candidate for
      maintenance because of its possible therapeutic value and ease of administration, but an
      optimum dose has not been determined. Since oral ganciclovir has a low bioavailability and
      is more soluble in an acid pH environment, the addition of glutamic acid hydrochloride may
      enhance gastrointestinal absorption of this drug.

      Long-term ganciclovir maintenance therapy has been recommended for CMV colitis or
      esophagitis following induction treatment. Oral ganciclovir is a likely candidate for
      maintenance because of its possible therapeutic value and ease of administration, but an
      optimum dose has not been determined. Since oral ganciclovir has a low bioavailability and
      is more soluble in an acid pH environment, the addition of glutamic acid hydrochloride may
      enhance gastrointestinal absorption of this drug.

      All patients receive an induction regimen of IV ganciclovir administered twice daily for 21
      to 42 (Per Amendment 3/4/95) days. A permanent venous catheter is implanted for the
      induction therapy. If clinically improved following induction, patients are then randomized
      to receive one of three doses of oral ganciclovir, given first without and then with oral
      glutamic acid hydrochloride, every 8 hours until they reach a steady state. PER AMENDMENT
      3/14/95: After subjects have reached steady state with oral ganciclovir and glutamic acid
      hydrochloride then PK samples will be taken. Subjects will continue the dosing regimen they
      were assigned to (glutamic acid hydrochloride will be added if it resulted in at least 33%
      increased bioavailability) for up to 12 months or until relapse of CMV GI disease is
      documented. Subjects will be followed at monthly intervals for safety evaluation and for
      evidence of CMV GI relapse. Subjects who have clinical symptoms of relapse will undergo
      repeat endoscopy or colonoscopy to document the relapse.
