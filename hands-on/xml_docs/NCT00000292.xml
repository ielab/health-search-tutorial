      The purpose of this study is to develop an experimental paradigm to examine acute withdrawal
      symptoms from cocaine.

      Although there are clearly identifiable withdrawal syndromes following cessation of a number
      of abused drugs such as alcohol and heroin, it is unclear whether a withdrawal syndrome
      follows the cessation of crack cocaine. A laboratory model of withdrawal from smoked (crack)
      cocaine would provide a safe and systematic method of testing the efficacy of behavioral or
      pharmacological treatments for withdrawal symptoms following cocaine smoking cessation.
      Therefore, this study investigated acute behavioral, subjective, and physiological
      withdrawal symptomatology for 6 hrs following 7 deliveries of 2 dose sized (0.07 vs. 0.4
      mg/kg) of smoked cocaine. The behavioral measure was performance on a computerized reaction
      time task, subjective measures included participant and observer ratings of mood and
      withdrawal symptomatology, and physiological measures comprised heart rate and blood
      pressure. It was hypothesized that signs and symptoms of withdrawal from smoked cocaine
      would be greater following the 0.4 mg/kg dose size, compared to the 0.07 mg/kg dose size.
