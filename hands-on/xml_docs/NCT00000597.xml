      To determine the therapeutic effects of anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) in patients with
      aplastic anemia and related bone marrow failure diseases.

      BACKGROUND:

      Aplastic anemia has been shown to respond to ATG. An immunological basis for aplastic anemia
      has been suggested by previous observations although the precise mechanism of action of ATG
      has not been defined. This serum, produced by immunization of horses with human thymocytes,
      may have broad reactivity with many human cells.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Patients in Group I with acute severe disease were randomized to receive ATG in either ten
      day or twenty-eight day courses. Patients in Group II with moderate or chronic disease were
      randomized to receive either ATG for ten days or high doses of the androgen, nandrolone
      decanoate. Patients in Group III with a variety of bone marrow diseases were also treated
      with ATG.

      The study completion date listed in this record was inferred from the last publication
