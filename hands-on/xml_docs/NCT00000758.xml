  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the efficacy and safety of intravaginal fluorouracil administered as
      prophylaxis in HIV-infected women who have received standard ablative therapy (surgery) for
      high-grade cervical dysplasia (pre-cancer of the cervix; cervical intraepithelial
      neoplasia). To correlate time to recurrence of cervical dysplasia with T-cell function.

      Women with HIV infection are at greater risk for cervical dysplasia. Because of the
      likelihood that untreated or recurrent cervical dysplasia may progress to invasive cancer,
      there is an urgent need to develop appropriate therapies.

      Women with HIV infection are at greater risk for cervical dysplasia. Because of the
      likelihood that untreated or recurrent cervical dysplasia may progress to invasive cancer,
      there is an urgent need to develop appropriate therapies.

      Patients are randomized to receive either intravaginal fluorouracil or no treatment
      (observation only). Fluorouracil cream is self-administered via applicator at biweekly
      intervals for 6 months. Patients are evaluated for recurrent cervical dysplasia by cytology
      and colposcopy with or without biopsy.
