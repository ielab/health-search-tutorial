      BACKGROUND:

      The trial was the first randomized, controlled trial to determine whether patients outside a
      hospital could be motivated to make and sustain comprehensive lifestyle changes and whether
      coronary disease regression could occur as a result of lifestyle changes alone.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Patients were randomly assigned to an experimental group or to a usual-care group.
      Experimental-group patients were prescribed a lifestyle program including a low-fat
      vegetarian diet, moderate aerobic exercise, stress management training, stopping smoking,
      and group support. No animal products were allowed in the vegetarian diet except egg white
      and one cup per day of non-fat milk or yogurt. The diet contained approximately 10 percent
      of calories as fat. Control-group patients were not asked to make lifestyle changes.
      Coronary angiography was performed at baseline and at one year to assess progression or
      regression of disease. Patients were recruited into the trial between January 1986 and
      November 1988. The trial was supported prior to April 1989 from various sources other than
      the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Follow-up continued for four years.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the Query/View/Report
      (QVR) System.
