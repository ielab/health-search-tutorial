    <textblock>
      Back pain is one of the most common of all symptoms. It is also a great cause of days lost
      from work and visits to health care providers. This study will develop and evaluate an
      approach to low back pain that allows subjects to talk with each other and with health
      professionals via an Internet discussion group. Results we will look at include health
      behaviors, such as exercise; health status, such as pain and disability; and health care
      use, such as number of visits to doctors and other health care providers. Anyone 18 years
      old or older who lives in the United States and has ongoing Internet access can take part in
      the study. All subjects must have back pain and meet the eligibility criteria listed below.

      This study will develop and evaluate in a randomized trial a low back pain intervention that
      allows subjects to talk with each other and with health professionals via an Internet
      discussion group. The intervention consists of a book and a videotape and is based on
      interaction with other participants in the program and health professionals through a closed
      password protected moderated Internet discussion group. Outcome measures include health
      behaviors, such as exercise; health status, such as pain and disability; and health care
      use, such as number of visits to doctors and other health care providers. Patients will be
      randomized either to the treatment group and followed for 6, 12, 18, and 24 months with the
      intervention.
