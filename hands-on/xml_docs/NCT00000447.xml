      This study will develop a behavioral and drug relapse prevention program for individuals who
      are dependent on both alcohol and tobacco. The study's goal is to show that individuals
      receiving nicotine replacement therapy and naltrexone (Revia) with behavior therapy will
      have higher rates of abstinence from both smoking and drinking than individuals who do not
      receive the drug therapies. Individuals will be placed in a 12-week outpatient treatment
      program with followup assessments 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment.
