      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of sodium valproate (Depacon) in
      treating individuals with alcohol dependence and comorbid bipolar disorder.

      The aim of this study is to test the mood stabilizer, anticonvulsant, sodium valproate in
      individuals with alcohol dependence and bipolar disorder, in a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, and randomized trial of 6 months duration. All subjects are treated with
      treatment as usual, which include lithium carbonate and individual dual recovery counseling
      and are randomized to either sodium valproate or placebo.
