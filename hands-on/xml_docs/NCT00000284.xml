  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a metabolite of nicotine,
      cotinine, on tobacco withdrawal symptoms. Cotinine has been shown to have psychoactive
      effects that are similar as well as different from those of nicotine, however, little
      research has been conducted examining the role cotinine plays in nicotine addiction. This
      study compared the effects of cotinine with the nicotine patch, and a combination thereof on
      tobacco withdrawal symptoms. The results showed that cotinine antagonizes the beneficial
      effects of the nicotine patch in reducing withdrawal symptoms.
